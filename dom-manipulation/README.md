We're creating a web application that dynamically generates content based on user input and interactions. This project will provide hands-on experience with creating, modifying, and managing elements in the DOM, demonstrating the core capabilities of JavaScript for building interactive web pages.

Application Overview:
1 Create a 'Dynamic Quote Generator' that displays different quotes based on user-selected categories. Include functionality to add new quotes and categories dynamically through the user interface.

2 Write a JavaScript file (script.js) that handles the creation and manipulation of DOM elements based on user interactions.
  Manage an array of quote objects where each quote has a text and a category. Implement functions to display a random quote and to add new quotes called showRandomQuote and createAddQuoteForm` respectively
  
3 Enhance the application to allow users to add their own quotes through a simple form interface. Update the DOM and the quotes array dynamically when a new quote is added.
